#Website blurb\
##Purpose\
The purpose of my website is to host and showcase in an interesting way to those interested my previous works, as well as being centralised hub for anything to do with me and social media.\

##Functionality/features\
I decided to make my project a one-page website, with the information on there being specifically curated into responsive, full-screen pieces. Users can navigate via scrolling, the hamburger menu or the downward chevron to explore the site. There are plentiful links on there to guide the user to whatever else they may be interested in eg. github code or social media pages.

There is minimal animation happening on the pages, as I prioritised a 60fps and low gpu impact experience, but just enough to improve the aesthetic of the site.

##Sitemap\
The website is all on one page. Any other links redirect to other websites.\

##Target audience
##Tech stack
The website is built on a tech stack which includes HTML5 to create the content, Sass- a CSS3 precompiler to stylise the web page and a smidgen of jQuery for snap-scrolling and directing animation when elements are visible in the viewport. Git is also used for version control and the website is hosted on Github.\
